Wildfires in California have been on the rise, especially in recent years, and have caused destruction and devastation in its wake. Analyzing this wildfire data will give insight into potential patterns that may exist and perpetuate in the future.\n","\n","Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the dataset being utilized. This provided a basic understanding of several factors associated with wildfires including timing, size, and the locations of wildfires in California. Later, several machine learning models were created in order to predict if a fire would be classified as major or not as well as predict the location of future fires. The results of that analysis are described below.\n","\n","## Who Might Be Interested?\n","\n","Given that the data is provided by the California Government, the local, state, and federal Government could potentially be interested in viewing and understanding our data analysis. Scientists and Data Scientists could find this data and report useful based on the increasing frequency and severity of fires that have plagued not only California but North America as a whole."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LlDfhljnA-81"},"source":["# Data Set\n","\n","This report utilizes the California Data set developed by the California State Government and is hosted on Kaggle.

We begin with replacing all the NaN (Not a number) values in the database with 0. Replacing it with 0  makes sense in this database because the variables are quantifiable. For example, the *StructuresDestroyed* columns has numerical values but also has NaN values. We can reasonably assume that the NaN values would correspond to 0 in this case.\n","\n","The next step the team took involved converting the dates in the dataset from UTC to be decomposed into years and months.
